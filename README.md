## Usage

This discord bot is designed with flexablity in mind. The core pricinple for it is to listen to a game log and to react and summarize events in the given log. This can be any kind of game that logs details of events to a text file. In theory this bot should work with other game such as CSGO, Minecraft, GTA, ... and many more.

In the current version the bot listens to 3 types of log entries:

* CTI_Mission_Performance: Starting Server
* CTI_Mission_Performance: GameOver
* ["CTI_Mission_Performance:",["time",110.087],["fps",49.2308],["score_east",0], ...

This helps the bot to understand the current state of the game, and helps it to report game starts and ends, and as well to create a summary of its performance.
These entries have to generated server side and for this version can be found here:

* <a href="https://github.com/zerty/Benny-Edition-CTI-0.97-Zerty-Modification/blob/5d71066fbab57764e0127f2467990379578f17c7/Server/FSM/update_victory.fsm#L82-L108">Registering the Winner of a round</a>

Right now it is very important that the data array is logged in a format that can be interpreted by python as a valid data structure.
Valid: [{"Data1": 10}, {"Data1": "String"}, ["Data2"]]
Invalid: ["Data": String]
